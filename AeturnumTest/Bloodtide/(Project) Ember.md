A young looking girl said to be made from the [[God Vessel]] [[Myria]] using alchemy in an old world Laboratory located in the Outlands. Recovered during Bloodtide 3. 
Ember had been kept in a coffin with a iron collar around her neck suppsoedly to keep her controlled.

Her behavior and skills seemed very childlike, but she had the power to burn out the blood infection. Which sometimes burned away the person but could also heal [[Bloodkin]].
